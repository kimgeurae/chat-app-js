Welcome to my chat-app repository!

This project was developed with nodeJS and some libs, the most important one's being socket.io and express.

The goal of this application was to give a good basic chat-app based in room's where users can chat freely with some language moderation and nice user experience by notifying user events like when a user join or disconnects from a room and the room name with the connected users listed in a nice sidebar.

For the future, my next goals after studying some html, css, and some js frameworks probably react or svelte is to turn this project into a small but funny game, something like a mad clicker that would save and register user highscore as long as the user is connected to the room.
Probably the flow of the application would be very similar to it's current state. The following diagramn represents the future application flow.

enter room page <-------> room page <-------> Minigame page

Also in the enter room page probably some room's may be highlighted so user can find themselves in some public default named room's.

That's basically the goal i'm hoping to archive when i finish studying my other fullstack courses.

Thanks for reading, hope see you there playing someday!
